                <p> At noon on 1 March, a crowd of at least 10,000 protesters held a rally in front of the French embassy in Yerevan.
                   Police officers pulled away from the area by 4 pm, as they were overwhelmed by the growing number of demonstrators.
                    Activists then used abandoned police buses to set up barricades. 
                    In the evening, clashes broke out between riot police and about 2,000 protesters who barricaded themselves at Miasnikyan Square. </p>

            <p>At around 10 pm, President Robert Kocharyan, with the approval of the Armenian parliament, declared a 20-day state of emergency, 
                banning future demonstrations and censoring the media from broadcasting any political news except those issued by official state press releases.
                Kocharian justified the decision on the grounds that a minority of demonstrators looted a nearby grocery store on Mashtots Avenue and set fire to a handful of police vehicles and buses.
